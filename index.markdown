I am Michael Walker, otherwise known online as **barrucadu**. I am
currently a **Ph.D student** in the **Department of Computer Science**
at the **University of York**.

My research relates to **nondeterministic concurrency in pure
functional programming languages**, such as **Haskell**. Increasingly,
turning to concurrency for performance gains is a no-brainer, but it
can be hard to get it right. Concurrency is hard in a number of areas:

- Testing, due to nondeterminism inherent in the underlying primitives
  and abstractions, meaning we need **new techniques**.
- Formal verification, in the presence of abstractions like
  **first-class functions**, **lazy evaluation**, and **"higher-order"
  state**; many of which are essential in a pure functional language.
- Optimisation, as compiler optimisations typically stop as soon as
  **side-effects** are involved.

My recent work has been on checking temporal logic properties of
concurrent Haskell programs, building upon the Deja Fu work documented
in a paper and a technical report. I plan to submit a paper on this to
[RV'16](https://rv2016.imag.fr), I am also preparing a new account of
Deja Fu to submit to the Journal of Functional Programming.

The plans for the rest of my Ph.D include:

- Systematic testing of temporal logic properties *(current work)*.
- Safe, automated, concurrency introduction for generate-and-test
  search computations.
- Using types to enforce interesting concurrent safety properties,
  beyond just deadlock freedom.

See my [publications](publications.html) and [CV](cv.pdf). If you're
looking for something to work on, see my
[project ideas](projects.html).
