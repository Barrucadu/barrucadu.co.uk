I am Michael Walker, otherwise known online as barrucadu. I am
currently a Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science at the
University of York.

My academic interests include functional programming, compilers, type
systems, and program verification. My non-academic interests include
small fuzzy animals, but sadly I can't sit in an office and play with
those all day. Yet.

See my [publications](publications.html) and [CV](cv.pdf).
