I am Michael Walker, otherwise known online as **barrucadu**. I am
currently a **Ph.D student** in the **Department of Computer Science**
at the **University of York**.

My research relates to **nondeterministic concurrency in pure
functional programming languages**, such as **Haskell**. Increasingly,
turning to concurrency for performance gains is a no-brainer, but it
can be hard to get it right. Concurrency is hard in a number of areas:

 - Testing, due to nondeterminism inherent in the underlying
   primitives and abstractions, meaning we need **new techniques**.
 - Formal verification, in the presence of abstractions like
   **first-class functions**, **lazy evaluation**, and **"higher-order"
   state**; many of which are essential in a pure functional language.
 - Optimisation, as compiler optimisations typically stop as soon as
   **side-effects** are involved.

I am currently working on testing and formal verification. After that,
I plan to look into **supercompilation** of concurrent programs,
aiming to execute as much of the computation at compile-time as
possible.

See my [publications](publications.html) and [CV](cv.pdf).
