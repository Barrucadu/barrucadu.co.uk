I am Michael Walker, otherwise known online as barrucadu. I am
currently a graduate of Computer Science from the University of York,
due to start a Ph.D in the same in September. In the mean-time, I'm
interning at [CoreFiling](http://www.corefiling.com/) and wondering
what to do with my life.

My academic interests include functional programming, compilers, type
systems, and operating systems. My non-academic interests include
small fuzzy animals, but sadly I can't sit in an office and play with
those all day. Yet.

See my [CV](cv.pdf) and [presentations and publications](publications.html).
