I am Michael Walker, otherwise known online as **barrucadu**. I am
currently a **Ph.D student** in the **Department of Computer Science**
at the **University of York**.

My research relates to **nondeterministic concurrency in pure
functional programming languages**, such as **Haskell**. Increasingly,
turning to concurrency for performance gains is a no-brainer, but it
can be hard to get it right. Concurrency is hard in a number of areas:

 - Testing, due to nondeterminism inherent in the underlying
   primitives and abstractions, meaning we need **new techniques**.
 - Formal verification, in the presence of abstractions like
   **first-class functions**, **lazy evaluation**, and **"higher-order"
   state**; many of which are essential in a pure functional language.
 - Optimisation, as compiler optimisations typically stop as soon as
   **side-effects** are involved.

My recent work has been on systematic testing in the presence of
**relaxed memory**, where caching can delay the visibility of
writes. The sequentially-consistent portion of this work is documented
in one of my papers, and I am in the process of writing a technical
report on the further developments. I have also started investigating
the verification of my testing framework, in the
[Isabelle/HOL](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle) proof
assistant.

See my [publications](publications.html) and [CV](cv.pdf). If you're
looking for something to work on, see my
[project ideas](projects.html).
