  <h1>Hello,</h1>

  <p>
    I'm <strong>barrucadu</strong>, also known in meatspace as <strong>Michael Walker</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I <a href="https://bookdb.barrucadu.co.uk/">read books</a> (mostly sci-fi &amp; fantasy, but I've been getting into history too);
    I <a href="https://www.anime-planet.com/users/Barrucadu/">watch anime</a>;
    I <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/">program things for fun</a> (and <a href="cv.pdf">for work</a>);
    I play and think about roleplaying games a lot, and <a href="https://www.lookwhattheshoggothdraggedin.com/">sometimes write about them</a>.
    I <a href="https://weeknotes.barrucadu.co.uk/">write weeknotes</a>, updated every Sunday with what's going on in my life.
    I used to be into boardgames, but I'm not so much anymore; similarly computer games.
    I bake acceptable bread.
    I enjoy listening to metal of all sorts (but casually&mdash;don't expect me to converse intelligently on it).
    <br>
    <small>I don't know what else to write here.</small>

  <h2>Fun</h2>

  <h3>Programming</h3>
  <p>
    I like programming and tinkering with DevOps in my spare time.
    My go-to languages are <strong>Haskell</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Rust</strong>.
    I run <strong>NixOS</strong> on all my machines.
    I like <strong>Configuration as Code</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can see all my projects <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/">on GitHub</a>.  Some favourites are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/dejafu">Déjà Fu</a>, a library for testing concurrent Haskell programs, which came out of my Ph.D.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/resolved">resolved</a>, a DNS server and adblocker designed for home networks.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/thing-doer">thing-doer</a>, a simple container orchestrator written to learn how those things work.</li>
    <li>My <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/nixfiles">NixOS configuration</a>, an endless source of tweaking.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the past I've also served as project leader for <a href="https://github.com/archhurd">Arch Hurd</a>, a <strong>GNU/Hurd</strong> distribution based on <strong>Arch Linux</strong>; and worked as one of the first few developers for <a href="https://github.com/uzbl">Uzbl</a>, a Webkit-based web browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also have some Haskell IRC libraries: <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/irc-ctcp">irc-ctcp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/irc-conduit">irc-conduit</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/irc-client">irc-client</a>.  But these are essentially abandonware right now.  If you want to maintain them, get in touch!
  </p>

  <h3>Roleplaying Games</h3>
  <p>
    My current games of choice are <strong>Call of Cthulhu (7th edition)</strong>, <strong>Traveller (Mongoose 2nd edition)</strong>, and <strong>Old School Essentials</strong>.  I also greatly enjoy <strong>Dolmenwood</strong>, <strong>Delta Green</strong>, and <strong>ALIEN</strong>.  I'm not really a fan of storygames, being pretty firmly in the &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;OSR&quot; camps.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now I'm running one regular game, a campaign of <strong>The Halls of Arden Vul</strong>: the greatest megadungeon ever written.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also run a <a href="https://www.lookwhattheshoggothdraggedin.com/">TTRPG blog</a>, updated infrequently.

  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>
    I'm a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a> on the <strong>Merchant Engagement</strong> team.
    We have a wide remit covering much of everything that existing customers directly interact with.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before GoCardless, I worked for the Government Digital Service on <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like working on tricky technical challenges, and gravitate to <strong>infrastructure</strong> or <strong>backend</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    See <a href="cv.pdf">my CV</a> for a bullet-point highlight reel.

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <p>
    I did a Ph.D at the <strong>University of York</strong> on the topic of <strong>testing concurrent Haskell programs</strong>.
    I ultimately decided that academia wasn't for me, but I'm glad I stuck it out to the end.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's a <a href="publications/thesis.pdf">PDF of my thesis</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I published a couple of papers too:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>One about <a href="publications/dejafu-hs15.pdf">testing concurrent Haskell programs</a>.</li>
    <li>And another about <a href="publications/coco-flops18.pdf">discovering properties of concurrency APIs</a>.</li>
  </ul>
