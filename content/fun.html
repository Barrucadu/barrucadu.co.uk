  <h2>Akkadian</h2>

  <p>I am learning Akkadian, the main language of Mesopotamia from around 2500BC to 500BC (though it continued to be used as a scholarly language until around 100AD).  It's challenging, as I don't speak any other languages (due to hating the way they were taught in school), but fun!</p>

  <p>I picked it up because I've always had a casual interest in ancient history (and ancient Mesopotamia specifically), and finally decided to make something of it.</p>

  <p><strong>Coming soon:</strong> there will be a separate page covering the basics of the language, how I am learning it (including pointers to resources I have found useful), and translations I have done.</p>

  <h2>Books</h2>

  <p>I have <a href="https://bookdb.barrucadu.co.uk">an extensive book collection</a> (tracked in a tool I wrote myself) and have something on the go more-or-less always.  I mostly read fiction, specifically <strong>sci-fi and fantasy</strong>, but I also have a fair amount of <strong>manga and light novels</strong>, and a small nonfiction section (mostly <strong>ancient history</strong>).</p>

  <p>Some of my favourite books and series are (list subject to change at a whim):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Book of the New Sun &mdash; Gene Wolfe</li>
    <li>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever &mdash; Stephen Donaldson</li>
    <li>Discworld &mdash; Terry Pratchett</li>
    <li>The Great God Pan &mdash; Arthur Machen</li>
    <li>Helliconia &mdash; Brian Aldiss</li>
    <li>The Lord of the Rings &mdash; J. R. R. Tolkien</li>
    <li>The Malazan Book of the Fallen &mdash; Steven Erikson</li>
    <li>Nana &mdash; Ai Yazawa</li>
    <li>Star Maker &mdash; Olaf Stapledon</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I am vehemently against annual reading targets, as I find they make me prioritise books by their length, rather than how interested I am in them.</p>

  <h2>Programming</h2>

  <p>
    I like programming and tinkering with DevOps in my spare time.
    My go-to languages are <strong>Haskell</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Rust</strong>.
    I run <strong>NixOS</strong> on all my machines.
    I like <strong>Configuration as Code</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can see all my projects <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/">on GitHub</a>.  Some favourites are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/dejafu">Déjà Fu</a>, a library for testing concurrent Haskell programs, which came out of my Ph.D.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/resolved">resolved</a>, a DNS server and adblocker designed for home networks.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/thing-doer">thing-doer</a>, a simple container orchestrator written to learn how those things work.</li>
    <li>My <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/nixfiles">NixOS configuration</a>, an endless source of tweaking.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the past I've also served as project leader for <a href="https://github.com/archhurd">Arch Hurd</a>, a <strong>GNU/Hurd</strong> distribution based on <strong>Arch Linux</strong>; and worked as one of the first few developers for <a href="https://github.com/uzbl">Uzbl</a>, a Webkit-based web browser.

  <h2>Roleplaying Games</h2>

  <p>
    My current games of choice are <strong>Call of Cthulhu (7th edition)</strong>, <strong>Traveller (Mongoose 2nd edition)</strong>, and <strong>Old School Essentials</strong>.  I also greatly enjoy <strong>Dolmenwood</strong>, <strong>Delta Green</strong>, and <strong>ALIEN</strong>.  I'm not really a fan of storygames, being pretty firmly in the &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;OSR&quot; camps.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now I'm running one regular game, a campaign of <strong>The Halls of Arden Vul</strong>: the greatest megadungeon ever written.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also run a <a href="https://www.lookwhattheshoggothdraggedin.com/">TTRPG blog</a>, updated infrequently.
