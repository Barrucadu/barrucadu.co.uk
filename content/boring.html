  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>
    I'm a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used to work on the nitty-gritty of how money flows through our systems, and led an interesting project to make it possible to localise our daily payouts process for different currencies, to take better advantage of local scheme timings and get money to our merchants faster.  Early in 2024 I changed teams into a more merchant-facing role, working on new features and functionality that are more directly visible to the end-users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before GoCardless, I worked at <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>, doing a variety of things.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like working on tricky technical challenges, and gravitate to <strong>infrastructure</strong> or <strong>backend</strong>.  As you can see from this website, I'm not very good at frontend.

    See <a href="cv.pdf">my CV</a> for a bullet-point highlight reel.

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <p>
    I did a Ph.D at the <strong>University of York</strong> on the topic of <strong>testing concurrent Haskell programs</strong>.
    I ultimately decided that academia wasn't for me, but I'm glad I stuck it out to the end.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's a <a href="publications/thesis.pdf">PDF of my thesis</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I published a couple of papers too:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>One about <a href="publications/dejafu-hs15.pdf">testing concurrent Haskell programs</a>.</li>
    <li>And another about <a href="publications/coco-flops18.pdf">discovering properties of concurrency APIs</a>.</li>
  </ul>
