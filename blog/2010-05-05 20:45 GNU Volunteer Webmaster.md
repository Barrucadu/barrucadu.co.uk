After applying in January, getting accepted last month, and becoming a full webmaster this month, I am now a GNU volunteer webmaster! I join a crack team of other volunteers, some of whom have been GNU webmasters for years, fixing and improving www.gnu.org when things need doing.

In fact, I've already made my first contribution. See the **Free Software Users' Group - Idukki** link on the [fs-user-groups page](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/fs-user-groups.html)? I did that :)

The GNU website uses CVS (Concurrent Versions System, for the uninformed), an early version control system. Any changes committed to the repository become instantly visible on gnu.org, so care is essential. Until recently I didn't know any CVS at all, but I found a guide for beginners through google and can now use it for basic things, which is all I need, really. Knowing how to use Git beforehand definitely helped me pick up what the commands do though, one thing I have noticed, compared to Git, CVS is *slow*.

Oh, and I have a new email address. Nothing says "Free Software Geek" like @gnu.org email.
