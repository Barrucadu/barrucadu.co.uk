Well, as I have now (and have for a few days) finished my first term at university, I think it's apt to reflect upon what I've learned, achieved, and done during that time, and my plans for the next term.

Firstly, obviously, there is the course; the reason I went to university. During this past term I've improved my rather basic knowledge of Java to a pretty good one, as alas Java is used as the teaching language. I've learned quite a bit about the maths behind comp sci (well, mostly logic thus far) and algorithms, as well a bit about the history of computers and how they work. Next term I intend to continue learning, and just see what happens.

Secondly, there's the whole living-away-from-home thing, something I've never done before. The first week or so felt pretty surreal, but now it just feels something like staying in a hotel, and perfectly normal. I've got on well with my flatmates, learned that I have zero inspiration when it comes to cooking (beyond chilli and incredibly bizarre meals), and that ironing is boring and completely unnecessary if you just fold things or hang them up. I can proudly say I've only ironed once, and intend to keep it that way :P

Thirdly, there's the social aspect of university. I've joined a number of societies, including the Kendo club—Kendo being a rather fun martial art that involves screaming at people and hitting them with big sticks—and also plan to join more, such as the Anime and Manga society, next term.

It's all been quite fun.
