We now have another mirror hosted in the UK - that makes two servers in the UK and two in Germany. This mirror is (currently) only available through HTTP. Mirrors outside Europe would also be awesome, so don't be shy :)

Many thanks to Positive Internet (their website is currently being re-done to be much nicer than what it is now, I'm told) for this latest mirror, and to the other two mirror providers.

Additionally, as you may have noticed, I have taken down the livecd from the Arch Hurd server, as we're getting very close to the bandwidth limit for this month. The livecd will return next month, and hopefully our bandwidth usage will remain low.
