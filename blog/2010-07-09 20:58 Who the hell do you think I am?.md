I just thought I'd give a quick update on my recent anime-watching and manga-reading, as it's not exactly often that I update what's on the about page. Possible spoilers follow, though I have tried to avoid any.

### Anime

#### Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

Also known as just *Gurren Lagann*, it's your typical mecha anime: giant robots, impossible feats, epic fights, a magic-like energy source… except this one brings in manliness and fighting spirit, too. It's only 27 episodes long, and I watched it across two days. I quite enjoyed it, and would recommend it.

It also has some great quotes, like "Don't believe in yourself. Believe in me who believes in you!"

#### School Days

This one is a must-watch, it's follows Itō Makoto's life through a period of time (about a year, I think) of his school life, and how he changes in that time. It may not sound very good or interesting from that description, but believe me, it is incredible. At a mere 12 episodes, you can't really refuse on the grounds of it being a waste of time if you don't enjoy it.

School Days started out as a visual novel, which has about twenty possible endings, depending on the choices you make when going through. Obviously, the anime shows only one of these endings. If you enjoy the anime, I suggest you also acquire the visual novel, something which I intend to do soon.

#### Umineko no Naku Koro ni

Another visual novel adaptation, Umineko is another great story. I personally am enjoying this more than School Days, but that could be because half the fun of Umineko is trying to solve the mystery. The series is split into four story arcs, one for each arc of the visual novel. The arcs are independent of each other, and tell different stories though key features are the same.

Umineko no Naku Koro ni is the story of the Beatrice the Golden Witch, come to collect her payment for lending Ushiromiya Kinzo a mountain of gold to rebuild the Ushiromiya family after it was ruined by an earthquake. In the process, she kills all of the Ushiromiya family and their servants, apparently using magic. The aim of the game is to solve the mystery and figure out how it was all done *without* magic, and, more importantly, who did it!

I have a theory, which is currently falling apart as I play through episode two in the visual novel, but I'm working on it...

#### 5 Centimeters per Second

This is a film, and follows the life of Takaki Tōno over a period of two decades. He and Shinohara Akari form a fast friendship at their elementary school and, when she moves away, he never quite gets over it. The story follows how this affects his relationships with others in his life, and is quite sad. This is another very good story.

### Manga

I've just got in to manga, so this list is very short for now.

#### The Ring

An anime adaptation of Ringu, and is pretty much identical to the film. I have yet to read the actual novel, so I don't know how close it is to that. Being the first manga I have actually read fully, I definitely enjoyed it. I have tried to get into manga before by reading it online, but that never worked for me. Same failing as ebooks, really: it should be on paper, but isn't, so I can't enjoy it.

The Ring is (have you been living under a rock if I need to explain this?) a story about an evil girl, killed and who projects her evil into a cursed videotape and kills all who watch it, exactly seven days after they have watched it. Obviously, the manga isn't quite as scary as the film...
