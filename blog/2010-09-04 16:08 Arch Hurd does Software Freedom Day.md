On Saturday the 18th of September, I and Matt (hayashi) will be at the Software Freedom Day event in Manchester; located in Madlab, lasting from 1000 to 1600. If you're going to the event, or will just be in the area (or city), drop by and say hi. Plans include:

Demonstration Machine
: We plan to bring a computer running Arch Hurd for people to have a look at. Haven't quite figured out the logistics yet (or which of us will be bringing the computer), but we'll definitely have one.

LiveCDs
: I'll bring a stack of (working) live cds to give away to anyone who wants one. I'm not sure how many to bring, but if I run out I'll just distribute copies of the ISO (if you have some form of portable media with you).

Meeting People
: This'll probably be what we'll spend most of the time doing, and it should also be the most fun. If you're in the area on the day, come and say hi :)

Keysigning
: if you have proof of identity, I'll make a note and sign your GPG public key when I get home after the event.

I've never gone to a free software event before, so this'll be a nice gentle start to our plan of showing up and giving a talk at ArchCon 2011 next year. It should be a fun day :)
