I am happy to announce the (almost) launch of [FlattrFeed](http://www.flattrfeed.com). At the time of writing, I'm still actually making it, and this post is a way of testing it. It's nearly done, though, so I shouldn't be much longer. I've signed up to Flattr, in an attempt to generate some revenue for Arch Hurd, and I decided to play with it and see what I could get for myself. The obvious way to do this is through my blog, but alas there is no Habari Flattr plugin yet. Thus, an idea was born...

I thought to myself, why make a plugin for one particular blogging software, when I can tackle *everything* with a feed in one go? So what started as a way to get my blog on Flattr, evolved very rapidly into a much grander idea. So, what is FlattrFeed? It is a simple system where you register, add your RSS and Atom feeds, and have it generate a page for users to flattr your articles either hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly (though I doubt many people will use that one).

To see an example of a user page, have a look at mine: [http://www.flattrfeed.com/user/barrucadu](http://www.flattrfeed.com/user/barrucadu). I'll add a more prominent link to my website and blog tomorrow.

In a way, this is a gamble. If I make back the money I spent on the domain, I'll keep it going. If not, I might take it down and write a Habari plugin. Or I might write one anyway. One thing that is certain, though, is that for now, FlattrFeed is here to stay. Enjoy!
