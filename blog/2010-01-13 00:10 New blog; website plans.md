Well, as you can see, I have decided to attempt blogging again. I'm hoping that, this time, I won't resort to meaningless drivel to fill the gap between the occasional good post ;)

I've decided to start a blog for a few reasons:

 * Identi.ca isn't ideal for longish stuff.
 * Some content on my website could be far better in blog format (eg: server stuff would, I think, work better as separate posts whenever I update it).
 * Reports on Arch Hurd status every time something exciting happens.
 * Somewhere to post random cool stuff I find.

So, I've got a few ideas. Tomorrow I plan on re-doing my website design, as well as doing the blog design, so they are matching and prettyâ€”it's too dark currently. Expect a flurry of posts over today and tomorrow as I exhaust my mental to-post list that's built up over the past few days :)
