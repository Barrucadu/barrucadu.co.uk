So, the logo contest I started on the 16th is now over, voting has been done, and a winner has been selected. I present to you, created by thoughtcrime and fastfret79, the new official Arch Hurd logo!

Now the project has a website, developers, a proper logoâ€¦ surely everything we need, right? Well, not quite. We still need packages, but wait, we have [one](http://repo.archhurd.org/extra)! Ok, so it's the archhurd-artwork package containing all the logo submissions but it's still a package.

Regarding the current status of Arch Hurd, we don't have a native toolchain or pacman running on the Hurd yet. Allan and I have been writing build scripts for everything we need, though, so it shouldn't be *too* long before we can run pacman and/or compile stuff. As always, help is welcomed, check the [Arch forum thread](http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=682472) to see what we're up to and contribute a build script or two if you're feeling helpful.
