This has already been covered by other bloggers but, as I <em>did</em> found the project (albeit accidentally), I think I'm justified in writing a post about it :)

[The Arch Hurd Project](http://www.archhurd.org) is a crazy-sounding project of porting Archlinux to the GNU/Hurd platform so we can all, as [Allan McRae](http://allanmcrae.com/) put it, bask in microkernally goodness. We're currently working on building a good cross-compiler and cross-compiled system (most of the pieces are in place, it seems), after which we'll cross-compile pacman, autoconf/automake, make, *et cetera* until we can start packaging things up. The first release is likely to be a QEMU image.

So, what exactly makes an OS Arch-like? As Arch is what you make it, that's a rather difficult question to answer, I did, however, narrow it down to a few things which I think are truly important for any Arch system:

 * Use of the pacman package manager.
 * Some form of ABS tree.
 * System-wide config file like /etc/rc.conf.
 * i686 optimisation.

Currently the i686 optimisation is proving to be a pain: we're not sure if it's something we've done, or something else. Yet. Pacman will, obviously, have to wait until we can actually boot it first, the [ABS tree](http://projects.archhurd.org/?p=packages.git;a=summary) is begun (as well as [repositories](http://repo.archhurd.org/)), and I don't think anybody has even thought about an /etc/rc.conf file yet—though it shouldn't be too difficult to alter the Hurd initscripts to pluck data from a config file.
