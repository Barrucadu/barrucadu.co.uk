Noticed the little array of buttons on the right there? They're the cause of the warm fuzzy feeling I'm currently experiencing. Of course, there's the normal warm fuzzy feeling that every webmaster feels when their site validates in both the (X)HTML and CSS versions of their choice, but there's another button there, cause of another warm fuzzy feeling.

I've just become a student member of the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org) and, with it comes several things:

 * Warm fuzzy feeling for supporting Free Software
 * My very own @members.fsf.org email address (contact page will be updated imminently)
 * USB membership card containing Trisquel Live, a completely free GNU/Linux distribution
 * Free entry to the LibrePlanet conference—just in case I ever decide to go
 * Discount from their shop (though I haven't really seen anything I like/want…)
 * And… a biannual postal bulletin, sent to me by genuine FSF postal monkeys.

Now, if only the GNU chief webmaster would get back to me about that volunteer webmaster position…
