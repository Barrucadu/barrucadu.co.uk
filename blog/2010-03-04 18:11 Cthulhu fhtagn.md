My laptop, Cthulhu, is, alas, dreaming. In my laptop bag currently, not quite as grand as his sunken city of R'lyeh, but it'll have to do for now.

On Friday (February the 26th), there was a graphical glitch in the morning. After using it for a while, the screen flickered and distorted, and black vertical bars appeared on the screen. The laptop was then completely frozen (graphically, at least). So, I did the first thing that came to mind: leave it and see if it goes away.

Later in the day, the same thing happened again, again shortly after turning it on. This time, I tried it with an external monitor to see if it was a problem with the LCD, but unfortunately it wasn't. So I took it apart to see if anything was overheating, but there was barely any dust in it. I tried booting into different OSes, to check if it was a software problem but, alas, no. Every time I booted, it happened a little sooner.

And now it happens more or less immediately after booting, it's a hardware problem, and the graphics are built-in to the motherboard, so I'd need to get a new motherboard to fix it. In a great departure from tradition, I've opted to build myself a desktop rather than spend a fortune on a new laptop.

This new desktop rising from the ashes of Cthulhu, shall be named... Azathoth!
