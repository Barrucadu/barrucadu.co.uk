I've been meaning to get rid of libetc for a while now, as it causes a bus error when used with the latest xorg-server package. My solution to that until now was to start xorg with **LD_PRELOAD= startx** but now my solution is a little more drastic and a little less hacky; I've removed it entirely.

For those who don't know, libetc is a handy little library that redirects all requests for files in ~/.* to ~/.config/*, massively tidying up your dotfiles, at the expense of sticking a library in LD_PRELOAD. I've been using it quite happily for a while, witha  patch I wrote, that rather than using ~/.config uses $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, and sports the ability to redirect some requests to $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_CACHE_HOME.

I've been putting off deleting it as, well, there was a lot of stuff in ~/.config. Then yesterday it hit me, for the vast majority of things in ~/.config, I haven't edited the configuration at all. So I could just delete them. That got the number of files down massively, then it was a simple matter of trial and error to figure out which stuff needed to remain in ~/.config, and which stuff went straight in ~. The whole process took me less than an hour; hardly the gruelling thing I expected it to be.
