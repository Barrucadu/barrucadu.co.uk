As you can never have enough mirrors (and we lost one recently), I set up a mirror of my own.

Additionally, I have been considering setting up a two-tier system, similar to what Arch Linux has, as we only have a 200GB bandwidth limit for archhurd.org. I shall monitor the bandwidth usage over the next couple of months and decide if this would be a good thing. If so, Carcosa will probably be the first tier one mirror (as it has a 10TB bandwidth limit). Alternatively, if I can shuffle my sites around and move everything hosted on yuggoth (barrucadu.co.uk) over to carcosa, then I will be down one linode and can use the extra money to upgrade the Arch Hurd one.
