When I created the very first incarnation of this website, it was a fairly rubbish thing housed at barrucadu.com. I'm not sure precisely when, but after a year or two I dropped the domain after getting bored of managing a personal website.

Then, leap through time to September, 2008, (wow, nearly two years already) when I felt the need to set up a personal website again. Alas, to my great dismay, I found that barrucadu.com had been registered shortly after I dropped it and, not really of the inclination to try to buy it back, I registered barrucadu.co.uk, but I always wanted barrucadu.com again. Today, I noticed that barrucadu.com was available and, today, I registered it and pointed it to barrucadu.co.uk.

I now have both domains, and one website :)
