Despite appearances, Arch Hurd isn't dead. I know there hasn't been any news for months, and barely any updates in that time either, but we've all been busy. Back in late September / early October many of us went off to our respective universities, which cut into Hurd-time. In short, we've all been very busy, please forgive us that. However, that doesn't forgive the *prolonged* lack of progress. That happened months ago, we've had plenty of time to adjust and resume development, but we haven't. I take the blame for that; as project founder I should have sooner seen fit to try to organise people into working again. It's our birthday in a couple of months, so I want us to be able to point to Arch Hurd and say "Look at that, look what we've made."

There's a meeting in IRC on Sunday (probably at 15:00 GMT) for bug-squashing and update-building. If you want to drop by and say how awesome we are, please feel free :)
