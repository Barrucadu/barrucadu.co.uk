As you may have noticed, I have merged my website and blog. This is because I barely updated my website, and so it wasn't really doing anything useful, and thus I decided it'd be better (and easier) if I just scrapped the separate blog and combined them into some sort of website-blog hybrid. You know, like most blogs out there. Anyway, there are bugs (makes it more fun), which are (or will shortly be) worked on. Additionally, I have a little to-do list which, incidentally, covers all of the bugs, unless there are any I haven't found:

 * Make the gallery css and template consistent with the one used in the rest of the blog (I just copied that across from the old website)
 * Update the 'about' page; I did edit it during the merge, combining it with the operating systems and contact pages, but I really need to read through it and update anything that needs updating.
 * Write a Habari flattr plugin  to have flattr images on all of my posts (hey, maybe also digg and 'like' buttons, too. I'll think about it)
 * Redesign barrucadu.co.ukâ€”this was the main motivation for the change, I want to overhaul my website (again)

TL;DR expect things to be broken and changing for a while. Hopefully I'll have a much better website by the end of it. blog.barrucadu.co.uk is currently redirecting traffic to barrucadu.co.uk, but it won't stay that way forever.

On an unrelated note, the new Arch Hurd livecd is progressing nicely. I expect to have it ready soon.
