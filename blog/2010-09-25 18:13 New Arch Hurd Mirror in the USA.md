Arch Hurd now has a mirror hosted by [Parabola GNU/Linux](http://www.parabolagnulinux.org) who, as per usual, we are very grateful to. In addition to being another mirror, this is our first mirror in the United Statesâ€”so it should be a bit faster for our American users (assuming we have any).

Parabola GNU/Linux is a completely free distribution based on Arch Linux, and remains compatible with Arch so changing to Parabola is as simple as changing your mirrorlist and updating. It is a very good project for any Archers who wish to stick to Free Software.
