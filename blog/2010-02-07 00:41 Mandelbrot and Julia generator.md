Over the past couple of days I've been working on what started as a Mandelbrot Set generator, but has expanded into a Julia Set generator and, with the growing number of command-line parameters, can generate other stuff too, like Tricorn and Multibrot sets. Currently I'm using the simple escape-time algorithm for generating colours, which looks a bit rubbish, but it's a start to having wonderfully coloured fractals.

I plan to write a viewer program at some point, to provide a graphical interface to generate and zoom fractals generated by the current program. The source code [can be found on github](http://github.com/Barrucadu/home/tree/master/code/c/fractal/) and is written in C.

My mandelbrot function is a slight variation of the original which allows an initial parameter.
