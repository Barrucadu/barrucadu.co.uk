If you have not done so already, first read the official announcement of the [Arch Hurd Netbook Remix](http://www.archhurd.org/news/21/). I shall now explain some of the motivations for this remix.

### The Myth of Wireless

Firstly, there seems to be some conventional wisdom that netbook users require wireless support to be able to use their netbooks efficiently when not next to a wired network connection. This is false! What is a netbook? A computer. What is the purpose of a computer? To perform mathematical computations. The presence, or lack thereof, of a network connection has no bearing on the efficiency of the performance of these calculations!

Constant network availability is merely a mental crutch for those who are unprepared! A <em>real</em> developer will do all of their research when a network connection is available, and so not need one at other times!

### Bluetooth? Just as bad.

Almost as bad as the 'need' for wireless connectivity is bluetooth. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you, do not be fooled by the different name. Bluetooth is just wireless networking under another guise, and so I shall not grace it with any further explanation.

### USB? Overrated.

What is USB most commonly used for on a netbook? External storage. What does this external storage do? Allow you to store more than you can on your HDD, and to exchange files with others. I shall now proceed to explain why both of these need not be done with USB.

Firstly, storing extra files. If you cannot fit all of your files on the internal HDD, clearly you did not plan your purchase properly, and so you have nobody but yourself to blame for your lack of space. Shame on you!

Secondly, exchanging files. There is no good reason why this cannot be done by the following process:

 * Shut down netbook
 * Insert bootable USB drive
 * Boot to live environment
 * Mount any appropriate partitions and transfer data
 * Reboot back into Arch Hurd

This is, in fact, a procedure I use daily.

### Release Date

Arch Hurd Netbook Remix shall be released after Hell freezes over, but before the heat-death of the universe.

By the way, have you noticed the date today?
