      <h1>Hello,</h1>

      <p>
        I'm <emph>barrucadu</emph>, also known in meatspace as <emph>Michael Walker</emph>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a <emph>Senior Developer</emph> working on <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a> for the <emph>Government Digital Service</emph>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time, I like programming and tinkering with DevOps for fun.
        My go-to languages are <emph>Python</emph>, <emph>Ruby</emph>, and <emph>Haskell</emph>.
        I run <emph>NixOS</emph> on all my machines.
        I like <emph>Configuration as Code</emph> and <emph>Infrastructure as Code</emph>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a <a href="https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk">blog</a>, updated weekly with what's been going on in my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also play, and think a lot about, roleplaying games.
        My current games of choice are <emph>Call of Cthulhu (7th edition)</emph> and <emph>Traveller (Mongoose 2nd edition)</emph>.
        I run a <a href="https://www.lookwhattheshoggothdraggedin.com/">TTRPG blog</a>, updated infrequently.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently the <emph>Tech Lead</emph> for GOV.UK's <emph>accounts and personalisation</emph> team.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're aiming to make it easier to use government services and to find things you need.
      </p>

      <p>
        I lead a small team of developers, and work with <emph>product</emph>, <emph>delivery</emph> and <emph>user-centred design</emph> teammates to define what we build and advise on relevant technical matters.
        I also work with more senior stakeholders, both technical and nontechnical, to ensure that what we're doing meets the GOV.UK vision and fits in with what other teams are doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past at GOV.UK I've also spent a lot of time working on <emph>search</emph>, upgrading <emph>Elasticsearch</emph> and productionising a <emph>machine learning search ranking system</emph>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like working on tricky technical challenges, and gravitate to <emph>infrastructure</emph> or <emph>backend</emph>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I did a Ph.D at the <emph>University of York</emph> on the topic of <emph>testing concurrent Haskell programs</emph>.
        I ultimately decided that academia wasn't for me, but I'm glad I stuck it out to the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a <a href="publications/thesis.pdf">PDF of my thesis</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I published a couple of papers too:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>One about <a href="publications/dejafu-hs15.pdf">testing concurrent Haskell programs</a>.</li>
        <li>And another about <a href="publications/coco-flops18.pdf">discovering properties of concurrency APIs</a>.</li>
      </ul>

        My main open source project is <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/dejafu">Déjà Fu</a>, a library for <emph>testing concurrent Haskell programs</emph>, which came out of my Ph.D research.
        You can write deterministic unit tests to catch race conditions and other such bugs.
        It comes with <emph>HUnit</emph> and <emph>Tasty</emph> bindings, so you can easily integrate it with your existing testsuite.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past I've also served as project leader for <a href="https://github.com/archhurd">Arch Hurd</a>, a <emph>GNU/Hurd</emph> distribution based on <emph>Arch Linux</emph>; and worked as one of the first few developers for <a href="https://github.com/uzbl">Uzbl</a>, a Webkit-based web browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also have some Haskell IRC libraries: <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/irc-ctcp">irc-ctcp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/irc-conduit">irc-conduit</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/barrucadu/irc-client">irc-client</a>.  But these are essentially abandonware right now.  If you want to maintain them, get in touch!
