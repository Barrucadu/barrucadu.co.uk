### Why "barrucadu"?

Aeons ago, when the world (or at least the part of the world that comprises me) was yet young, I and my brother used to play on a game network known as BYOND (which we have since both stopped using). He wanted to use "barracuda" as his username, misspelt it, and I took the name he coined. So my online identity is, effectively, stolen—though I've been using "barrucadu" long enough for it to definitely be my name. Also, it is most definitely "barrucadu", not "Barrucadu" (or any other variation). It just is.

### Operating Systems

#### GNU Hurd

Of course, the first mention has to go to the Hurd. I have been interested in the Hurd for some time, and early this year managed to accidentally found the [Arch Hurd](http://www.archhurd.org) project. My intended 'end point' for Arch Hurd is, well, I don't have one. I initially was going to stop when I had a basic range of packages, but interest grew, multiple developers signed on, and exciting things like websites and LiveCDs appeared. If one day I can run my home server on Arch Hurd I'll be very happy. Currently I use Arch Hurd exclusively through qemu, though I plan to do some hardware research (or wait for DDEkit to work better) and build a Hurd box to play with.

The Hurd is GNU's project for a kernel for the GNU operating system. Today, GNU is usually used with Linux, but that was not always the plan. Unfortunately, the Hurd has been around for quite some time and is still very far from done. The Hurd is, first and foremost, a set of protocols for the system to communicate and function. It is secondly an implementation of those protocols, currently using the GNU Mach microkernel at the core, though efforts have been made to port the Hurd to other microkernels.

#### GNU/Linux

I have used GNU/Linux on my main machine since May of 2007, and switched completely in November of the same year. In my time as a Linuxer I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge, and so a great familiarity with the system. I've gone through a number of distros, but managed to end up on Arch, which I don't think I'll be changing from any time soon, if ever. I have used:

 * *buntu
 * OpenSuSE
 * Fedora
 * Zenwalk
 * Debian
 * Arch

GNU/Linux is, as I'm sure you know, the GNU operating system using Linux as its kernel. Linux was written by Linus Torvalds whilst a student at Helsinki University. At the time, Linus described his OS project as "just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu". How wrong he was…

### Books

I spend a huge amount of time reading and have been known to digest entire reasonably-sized novels (*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* being an example) overnight; going without sleep or food if need be to keep the pages turning. Though, it usually doesn't feel anything like that long to me whilst reading. I used to read nothing but fantasy and think all other genres dull, with a few sci-fi books slipped in occasionally, making me grudgingly admit that maybe other genres weren't all written by foolish heathens who wouldn't know good literature if it danced in through their window on the back of a dragon and turned them into a toad—but, all that changed—I discovered H. P. Lovecraft and, through him, weird fiction.

Lovecraft sparked my interest in older fiction and, naturally, it was only a short step from Lovecraft to Poe, though it took me several months to make that step. I thought Lovecraft's writing style was odd—Poe's was almost alien. It took me a few attempts on some of his longer stories (and even some of his longer sentences!) before I understood them, but I persevered, which I am glad of, and Poe is one of my favourite authors now. Of course, I was familiar with him before I started reading Lovecraft (as I was with Lovecraft, I knew he was "that guy who came up with Cthulhu"), I assume more or less all serious readers have read, if nothing else, *The Raven*. A truly brilliant poem.

Between Lovecraft and Poe, I investigated other dark literature: *Dracula*, *Frankenstein*, *Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*; the classics of gothic horror. Then, more branching out: *The Picture of Dorian Grey*, *The Phantom of the Opera*, which is surprisingly different from the musical; and then on to Anne Rice's *Vampire Chronicles*, and Stephen King's many works, and I was hooked on the gothic and horror genres.

Whilst this branching out into the darker side of literature was taking place, I was also expanding my sci-fi library, initiated by one event: I saw a copy of *The Great Dune Trilogy*, published by Gollancz, in Waterstones one day. The cover interested me, and I recognised the Gollancz logo as the same publisher who had published the copies of the *Necronomicon* and *Complete Chronicles of Conan*, which I owned by that time. Thinking that if they published two great books, perhaps this one was also good, I read the first few pages. Then I realised I had to buy this book, so I put back some other books I had been planning to buy, and bought that. I now have nearly all of the *Dune* books, including the offshoot series. Frank Herbert was my Lovecraft of sci-fi.

So, in the span of several months (as this all took place within a year, I think), I changed from having a "if it's not fantasy (or one of a few select sci-fi authors) it's rubbish!" attitude, to owning and enjoying fantasy, science fiction, horror, and gothic fiction. I may still be a bit intimidated by Poe's writing, and a little wary of the sheer number of made-up words in Dune, but it's been a great journey. As an aside, if you also enjoy older fiction, a good podcast is [Darkly Lit](http://darklylit.wordpress.com), it covers old fiction in the public domain now—Lovecraft, Poe, M.R. James, *et al*. Additionally, a very good podcast covering Lovecraft is the [H. P. Lovecraft Literary Podcast](http://hppodcraft.com/).

Finally, I have a [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/barrucadu) account, from which you can glean more about my reading habits.

### Games

I greatly enjoy abstract strategy games, such as Chess, Go, and Shogi. An abstract strategy game is one with no chance and perfect information; that is, all players know of all moves which have taken place and all moves that they can make at each turn. Usually these games have two players, but that is not a restriction in the definition. I own a rather nice chess set from Athens, but alas do not own a Go set yet. I'm not very good at them as I tend not to think far enough ahead, but I enjoy them nevertheless.

Additionally, whilst not "games" in the traditional sense they are often classed as them, I enjoy visual novels; particularly the fantastic *Umineko no Naku Koro ni* and definitely intend to investigate further into this genre.

### Anime, Movies, and TV

Unlike my taste in books, I have enjoyed a variety of genres in anime and movies from the beginning, though my taste in TV series is restricted to sci-fi. Initially I began watching sci-fi anime because that is what the friend who nagged me into watching anime (and using GNU/Linux: this "friend" has a lot to answer for!) gave me the first series I endured—yes, endured is the perfect word—*Robotech*. Though, after a few episodes, it became less "enduring" and more "enjoying", so that is how my interest in anime began—much nagging and having anime copied to my laptop for me. From *Robotech* I branched out into other sci-fi, I discovered the brilliant *.hack franchise* when looking through another friends online profile on anime-planet: he'd flagged *.hack//SIGN* as "Won't Watch", which made me interested enough to see what it was at least. It sounded interesting, so I watched it and really enjoyed it, I really need to play the games at some point.

After I watched a few different animes came an explosion into other genres, from the silly (*Zero no Tsukaima* and *Chobits*), to the serious (*Neon Genesis Evangelion* and *Ergo Proxy*), to the ones with meanings so deep you can easily get lost in them (*Serial Experiments Lain*, which I found really dull the first time I watched it, and pretty good the second time). Of course, there were others I particularly enjoyed also, such as *FLCL* and *Rozen Maiden*. More recently I have watched the epic *Eureka Seven* which, despite being 50 episodes long, managed to remain interesting and enjoyable throughout, without feeling like it's dragging on.

In the realm of movies, I've always been a fan of zombie apocalypses. Nothing like a good planetary-wide plague of flesh-eating monsters who assimilate you with one bite—if they don't eat you alive kicking and screaming first—to start the day. In fact, I secretly (though not so secretly any more) wish the world *does* end in a zombie apocalypse, rather than a mere expansion of the sun as it burns up, stripping the atmosphere away, boiling the oceans, and generally making Earth an unpleasant place to be. How boring, give me undead monstrosities any day of the week: *they* at least are exciting.

Of course, I'm not restricted to zombie films alone, I watch many films. I would have to say that my three favourite films are *The Fountain*, *Serenity*, and *Sunshine*—all of which involve space, to a lesser or greater extent. I suppose in films I'm more of a sci-fi fan than anything else, with the exception of zombie films. Of course, I can't forget to mention a man of immense genius, to whom all of us mere mortals should look up and hope to be as great as he one day: Tim Burton. The greatest director of all time. The greatest actor of all time award goes to Johnny Depp. They work incredibly well as a team (*Sweeny Todd*, *Edward Scissorhands*), and just as well by themselves (*Mars Attacks*, *Pirates of the Caribbean*). Needless to say, I have a large number of both their movies in my collection.

And, finally, TV series: I'm not really a huge fan of TV. I generally only sit down in front of the TV when *Doctor Who* is on, and that takes priority over everything else. Even if the world were ending in a zombie apocalypse, I'd watch *Doctor Who* if it was a new episode. However, despite the high praise I have just given *Doctor Who*, I think it pales in comparison with the brilliance of *Firefly*. *Firefly* is, possibly, the greatest thing to happen in TV history—perhaps slightly less great than the invention of the television itself, but only by a small margin. If you haven't watched *Firefly*, I suggest—nay, order—you to do so as soon as humanly possible.

After *Doctor Who* and *Firefly*, the only other TV series I have watched and particularly enjoyed are *Babylon 5* and *Stargate SG-1*, and I enjoyed *Babylon 5* a lot more than *SG-1*. Both are quite good series, but I found *B5* more realistic than *SG-1*, for some reason. I can't explain it myself, but the *SG-1* universe, despite being set predominantly on Earth, with predominantly human characters, doesn't seem as real as a space-station with tens if not hundreds of different species, all of which happen to speak English and (mostly) just so happen to have the same atmospheric and gravity preferences as humans. In *SG-1* that's explained by the fact that the Goa'uld *use* humans, so it makes sense to pick planets they'll get along fine on, but it's never explained in *B5*.

So I am, unlike with anime and movies, a firm sci-fi fan with TV, and I don't think anything will come along any time soon to change that—though I felt the same way about fantasy before reading Lovecraft, so who knows what will happen…

### Music

My musical taste is quite varied but very restricted in one sense. I cannot stand pop music. I enjoy rock, metal (particularly with female vocals such as *Within Temptation* and *Sirenia*), some Italian pop (*Vasco Rossi* and *Zucchero*), and ambient/atmospheric music such as *Nox Arcana*, *Mortiis*, and *Die Verbannten Kinder Evas*. I enjoy soundtracks and musicals, and always have music playing on my server (via MPD, my audio player of choice), which is hooked up to my 2.1 speakers. I find that music helps me to concentrate and I can read more easily when ambient, wordless, music is playing in the background.

### Webcomics

I read a few different webcomics, most of which update multiple times a week, so I check them daily. I download all of them, so I have an offline archive; when I start reading another webcomic I have a lot of downloading/reading to do - such as when I started *Questionable Content*. I downloaded and read about 1200 comics in a day. Below is a list of what webcomics I read.
