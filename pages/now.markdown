This is a [now page][]. It shows you what my current focus is.

- Now in the final year of my Ph.D.
- Researching property-discovery of concurrent programs. Think [QuickSpec][] / [speculate][] but
  with more dejafu. I have my current work [on GitHub][spec].
- Slowly working through my large collection of bookmarked articles, papers, and podcasts:
- Becoming more financially aware by tracking my spending with [hledger][].

My future plans are:

1. Finish all research by the end of June.
2. Take a three month break to intern at [Overleaf][].
3. Write up my thesis.
