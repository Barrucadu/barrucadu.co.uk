This is a [now page][]. It shows you what my current focus is.

- Taking a Ph.D break by interning at [Overleaf][] until October.
- Working out my post-Ph.D life plans.
- Slowly working through my large collection of bookmarked articles, papers, and podcasts.

My future plans are:

1. Write and submit my thesis by the end of next March.
2. Get a job.
