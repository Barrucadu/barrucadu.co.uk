I'm living in Rickmansworth and working as a software engineer.

**Work:**

- I'm still working from home for the foreseeable future.  Maybe I'll
  have been vaccinated by the next update, but I'd rather not return
  to the office.
- I still work for the [Government Digital Service (GDS)][w1].
- For the last several months I've been tech lead for a small team
  doing discovery work into [GOV.UK Accounts][w2]. See my
  [weeknotes][w3] for more on that.

**Personal:**

- Now [running an RPG blog][p1], aiming to post once or twice a month.
- Still [tracking my time][p2], it's going well, but I always have a
  couple of hours of dead time a day...
- Still [tracking my finances][p3], working towards savings and
  investment goals I revise every few months.
- Still [reading][p4].  See my [weeknotes][w3] for thoughts on what
  I've been reading.
- Still [programming][p5], but *definitely* not as much as I'd like to.
