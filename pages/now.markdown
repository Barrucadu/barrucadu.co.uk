I'm living London and working as a software engineer.

**Work:**

- I passed my Ph.D, having submitted the final version of [the
  thesis][w1] in March.  Graduation is in July.
- I still work for the [Government Digital Service (GDS)][w2].  This
  past quarter I've been on a small team working on upgrading our
  Elasticsearch, and also migrating to a hosted service.  Next quarter
  I'm likely to be continuing with other search-related work.

**Personal:**

- Still [tracking my finances][p1], working towards savings and
  investment goals I revise every few months.
- Still [programming][p2], though maybe not as much as I'd like to.
- Still [reading][p3], but *definitely* not as much as I'd like to.
