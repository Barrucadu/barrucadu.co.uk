I'm living London and working as a software engineer.

**Work:**

- I've finally graduated my Ph.D and have the fancy bit of paper
  saying I'm a doctor, having submitted the final version of [the
  thesis][w1] in March.
- I still work for the [Government Digital Service (GDS)][w2].
  Recently I've been working on improving GOV.UK search, see my
  [weeknotes][w3] for more on that.

**Personal:**

- Still [tracking my finances][p1], working towards savings and
  investment goals I revise every few months.
- Still [programming][p2], though maybe not as much as I'd like to.
- Still [reading][p3], but *definitely* not as much as I'd like to.
