I'm living in London and working as a software engineer.

**Work:**

- I'm working from home for the foreseeable future.
- I still work for the [Government Digital Service (GDS)][w1].
- Recently I've been tech lead for a small team doing discovery
  work. See my [weeknotes][w2] for more on that.

**Personal:**

- Still [tracking my finances][p1], working towards savings and
  investment goals I revise every few months.
- Still [reading][p2], though maybe not as much as I'd like to.
- Still [programming][p3], but *definitely* not as much as I'd like to.
