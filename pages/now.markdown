I'm living London and working as a software engineer.

**Work:**

- I had my Ph.D viva in May 2018, having submitted [the thesis][w1] in
  March, and passed with corrections.  In December 2018 I finished the
  corrections and am preparing to submit the revised thesis.
- I work for the [Government Digital Service (GDS)][w2], on the
  Platform Health team (looking after everything not being actively
  developed by another team).

**Personal:**

- Still [tracking my finances][p1], working towards savings and
  investment goals I revise every few months.
- Still [programming][p2], but now most of my open source stuff
  happens on Sunday mornings.
