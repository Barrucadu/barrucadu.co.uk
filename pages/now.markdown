I'm living London and working as a software engineer.

**Work:**

- I had my Ph.D viva in May, having submitted [the thesis][w1] in
  March, and passed with corrections.  The corrections are due by June 2019.
- I work for the [Government Digital Service (GDS)][w2], on the
  Platform Health team (looking after everything not being actively
  developed by another team).

**Personal:**

- Still [tracking my finances][p1], on track to save three months of
  expenses by 2019.
- Still [programming][p2], but now most of my open source stuff
  happens on Sunday mornings.
