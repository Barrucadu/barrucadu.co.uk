### Holistic Mathematics: An Exploration into Category Theory

> Throughout the ages mathematics has been used in very practical and specific ways:
> dividing up farmland; calculating taxes; and building houses to name but a few and
> the key to the success of mathematics as a discipline is that it extracts the salient
> information from a problem and discards everything else. Thus the study of
> mathematics has been an exercise in repeated abstraction as we go from counting the
> number of eggs all the chickens produce on a farm to a system of arithmetic to a
> generalised notion of what addition and multiplication are in ring theory.
> 
> In this presentation we will look at how this repeated abstraction led to the concept of
> categories and how they can link disparate areas of mathematics together in a very
> elegant manner. We will also see how categories are used in a practical way in such
> diverse fields as physics, biology and music. Finally we hope to demonstrate that you
> can deal with mathematics as a whole rather than simply proving theorems in its parts.

Presentation given at [Tomorrow's Mathematicians Today 2013](http://mathsoc.cms.gre.ac.uk/tmt/) with Stijn S. C. Hanson. See the [slides](/publ/cat-theory-slides.pdf) and [my half of the presentation](/publ/cat-theory-presentation.pdf).
